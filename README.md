# CATalog

Source code for the CATalog application using React Boilerplate CRA.

## Introduction

This project is my very first try to create an application using ReactJS.

It consists of an application that lists cat breeds fetched from the The Cat API, a public API.
You can use these application to learn more about cat breeds, where are they from, their common
traits, if they are hypoallergenic, etc.

This application has the following features:

1. Lists every cat breed fetched from the The Cat API and stores them on your device
2. Details information about each breed
3. Allows the user to add or remove breeds from the favorites
4. Lists all the breeds that the user added to the favorites
